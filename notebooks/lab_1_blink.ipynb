The ```setup()``` function is executed only once when the program starts whilst the ```loop()``` implements the logic of our program which is executed continuously as long as there is power supply. The third function, ```pinMode``` is used to indicate how the pin with id the one specified as the first argument is meant to act. We have two options here namely ```INPUT``` or ```OUTPUT```. The fourth function,  ```digitalWrite()```, is used to control how the pin with id given as the first argument behaves. Finally, the ```delay(ms)``` function does what its name suggets put the program in  a hault for the specified duration in milliseconds. "
